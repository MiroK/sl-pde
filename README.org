** Sparse learning PDEs (with FEniCS/Basilisk generated data)

*** Structure
    - `/src/c` is the C code related to Basilisk data generation
    - `/src/python` is the python code for data generation in FEniCS and sparse learning

*** TODO
    - Handle (by Coordinate transforms?) learning in different coordinates?
    - If there data is large we want to 'schedule' how the linear system is built
    - Get up to speed with different regressors
    - Neural net approaches
